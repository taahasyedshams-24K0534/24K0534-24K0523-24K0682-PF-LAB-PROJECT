Such information will be saved using arrays which can later be also edited if the user requires. It will also include a feature that will ask the user by using prompts to enter ingredients of their choice and will send this data to a linked database which will in turn send back a recipe or a food item that could be created from the ingredients given by the user. The goal is to create a system where users can comfortably manage their cooking needs.
